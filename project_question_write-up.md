#Project Question Write-Up
### Michael Makris

##### Goals:
Predict arrival times and tendency for metro busses to arrive late/early based on:

* Past Performance
* Weather
* Known Traffic
* Time of Day
* Day of Week
* Season
* Stop Number

Measure the accuracy of One Bus Away's (OBA's) predictions at discrete intervals:

* 30 Minutes before Scheduled Arrival
* 20, 10, 5 minutes…
* 10 Stops Ahead… 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

##### Objective:
To improve mass transit rider experience by providing accurate predictions of local bus arrivals and trip time to destination.

A second possible objective is to aid riders decide which bus to take, when two will go to the same stop, based on predicted delays and arrival time of each competing bus.

##### Timeline:
Using bus GPS data and OBA predictions from April 11 to April 29 for Seattle Sound Transit Busses.

Alternatively, use a data set for the last two years from Tampa's HART agency, with access by a local user. The data is stored in a SQL database online, with access restricted.
